### Tools Utilized:
- SQL
- Power BI Desktop
- Excel
- DAX Language
- DAX Studio (for report optimization)

### Process:
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:**
   - Loaded raw data into Power BI using Power Query.
   - Performed necessary data transformations and cleaning to ensure data quality and integrity.

2. **Data Modeling:**
   - Developed comprehensive data models to create relationships between different tables.
   - Structured the data to facilitate efficient and effective analysis.

3. **DAX Calculations:**
   - Created measures and calculated columns using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to compute key metrics.
   - Enhanced the analysis with advanced DAX formulas to derive deeper insights.

4. **Dashboard Creation:**
   - Designed and built interactive dashboards using Power BI.
   -  Used a variety of visualizations to effectively communicate insights to the Executive Management.

## Key Achievements:
- Creating calculated columns for enhanced data analysis
- Building measures using DAX language to derive key metrics
